We are inviting you to join our small, fully remote team of developers and operators helping make our platform faster, more secure, and more reliable. You would help us deliver new features, explore different ways of problem solving, and discover, explain, and defend your choices in implementation.\n\nAt Crunch, we believe in learning together: we recognize that we don’t have all the answers, and we try to ask each other the right questions. Some of the ways that we accomplish that include paired programming to tackle a hard problem, transparent code reviews, and discussions about design and architecture. Since Crunch’s employees are completely distributed, it’s crucial that you can work well independently, and keep yourself motivated and focused. We move fast but carefully, with an earnest commitment to not breaking things… well, not too much.\n\nOn the front-end team, we feel strongly about developing solutions that are both technically and aesthetically sound. We invite you to bring your experience and perspective to conversations about the future growth of our applications and environment. We work closely together, with a healthy and non-combative review process aimed at improving code as well as developing each other’s skills. In short, we strive to write solid, thoroughly tested, and readable code; and we are seeking a new member of our already highly-effective team.\n\nWhat you’ll do\n• Work on new features with other front-end team members.\n• Triage, unravel, test, and resolve bugs and issues.\n• Update existing code in parallel with backend changes to ensure uninterrupted operation.\n• Review your colleagues’ work on pull requests.\n• Propose, discuss, and debate technology improvements, code organization, design patterns, and conventions employed in the front-end development environment.\n• Use your extensive experience to train and mentor other developers on the front-end team.\n\nOur stack\n\nFront-end developers on our platform are first-class team members. Although your focus is primarily on TypeScript, you will gain familiarity with the entire system. Some of the technologies that enable us to achieve our well-designed, efficient, and performant applications are:\n• TypeScript (latest specification)\n• Webpack + Babel (ES6 modules)\n• React + Redux\n• Styled Components\n• Unit testing with Jest (we have over 5500 unit tests across our app)\n• Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment\n\nIf you have experience or interest in these additional areas, you may have the opportunity to work with them as part of your role:\n• End-to-end testing using cypress\n• Responsive design / mobile / touch interfaces\n\nBasic qualifications\n• Advanced to expert-level React skills with demonstrated experience.\n• A firm command of Typescript.\n• Familiarity with JavaScript frameworks and libraries for building web applications.\n• Commitment to high development standards, including comprehensive testing.\n• Demonstrated ability to work with team of peers, understanding and respecting the responsibilities and expertise that developers, designers, QA staff, and others bring to the project.\n• Ability to provide reasonable estimates on work, meet deadlines, and take ownership and responsibility.\n• Well-developed principles of self-motivation and time management.\n• An appetite for continual improvement and growth.\n\nAdvanced (preferred) qualifications\n• Bachelor’s Degree in Programming, Computer Science, or Engineering-related field.\n• Current or former contributor to a significant open-source React library.",

The developer will be responsible for creating the marketing website from existing designs and for making the connection between the website and API, monitoring it, doing ongoing maintenance, and also aiding the team with making any content changes as time goes on.\n\n\"I love working with G2i because of the culture. Plus, I obtained both professional and financial growth thanks to the amazing clients they have. They really care about the entire developer experience.\" - Andrei Calazans\n\nAndrei's story is proof that vacancies you see at G2i are filled with healthy and fulfilled devs – which means this could not only be your next job, but the one after that as well.\n\nYou probably want to know what’s involved.\n\nIf you’ve been a Senior React Developer for years, you already know what it takes.\n\nIt’s all about delivering an amazing front-end experience. Keep your teammates happy. Keep the clients happy. All thanks to your production ready code, clear documentation, AND top notch communication skills.\n\nYou’ll work 100% remotely with US clients. Take your pick from the cutting-edge of FinTech and Crypto to those in traditional Food and Beverage industries, with plenty of choices in between. And since it’s a contracting position, once you finish a project you can easily move to the next one that floats your boat. We’ve got quite a few G2i alums who’ve stayed with us for several years doing just that.\n\nTeam sizes vary with each client but don’t worry, you’ll never be alone. We’ve got a really tight community of 800+ engineers on Slack that you can ask for help if you need it. You’ll also have a direct line to our Developer Success Team whose job is to have your back.\n\nTypical assignments are 32-40 hours per week, where you can bill up to $90 per hour. If you’re a stickler for detail, you might want to know that you’ll be working with technologies like React, Node.js, Typescript, Apollo, Next.js and popular deployment tools.\n\nG2i is the first hiring platform that focuses on developer health, which explains why we have plenty of opportunities for you to explore. We've seen burnout all too often in tech and we are on a mission to push back against it. We believe in maintaining a healthy work-life balance, and act on those beliefs by:\n• providing a 4-day (32-hour) work week\n• developing NFL-like support for burnout recovery, and\n• launching the Developer Health Fund\n\nNot to mention, we're literally writing the book on developer burnout prevention with our Restful Work OS.\n\nJust click “Apply Now”. We appreciate that your resume may not be up to date so just upload a PDF of your LinkedIn profile. You can then tell us everything else we need to know in a chat with the recruiting team and a technical interview with a fellow engineer.\n\nG2i is an equal opportunity employer. We’re dedicated to building a team where diversity in both ideas and identities is not only welcomed, but encouraged. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, disability, marital status, citizenship, national origin, genetic information, or any other characteristic protected by law.",

We work hard, have fun, and are always improving. Because we're a small shop, you must be self-motivated, able to manage your day-to-day schedule, and a very good communicator. You'll have the opportunity to have your hands in everything, from the data model to stylesheets, from concepts to launches, from process to implementation.\n\nIf you have a passion to help the Church, and enjoy dreaming up smart ways to solve problems and then watching your code come to life to make a real difference in the world, keep reading.\n\nYOU'LL BE:\n• Working to build out a robust app suite for Flocknote using React Native.\n• Shaping the way people use Flocknote and the entire structure of our front end architecture.\n• Creating new features within the Flocknote web app and new React Native apps that are easy & fun to use.\n• Managing the technical aspects of Flocknote's front end. Including increasing client-side performance and accessibility.\n• Tackling bugs post-release.\n• Strategizing building out the right features for apps vs web.\n• Integrating new features into a non-react front-end codebase. So experience integrating React with legacy code and understanding of using portals will be a big help here.\n\nYOU'LL NEED:\n• At least two years experience using React Native and a great understanding of its inner-workings and quirks.\n• Experience releasing apps to the app stores and an understanding of their setups, requirements, and approval cycles.\n• To understand node, Webpack, and babel (beyond just using create-react-app).\n• To love javascript, es6+, node and all things in that world.\n• Experience and comfort developing functional components and hooks. We won't be using class-based components at all.\n• To understand reducers, context, and state and the lifecycle of react components.\n• Taste! We don't pixel-perfect mock things up, so we'll be relying on some of your great ideas to make things easy to use.\n• To be a self-starter and a go-getter.\n• To have strong interpersonal skills and be flexible, detail-oriented, professional, easy to get along with, enthusiastic and of high moral character.\n\nBONUS POINTS\n• Any relative app design experience\n• UI transition and animation experience in React Native\n• Experience using Expo to build and deploy apps\n• Setting up apps to receive push notifications\n• Experience developing cross-client email design and understanding differences in HTML layout and compatibility issues for various email clients.\n• Experience with relational data models.\n\nAll positions are full-time (remote/work-from-home) positions with salary and benefits.",
